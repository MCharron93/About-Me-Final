        <p>I have many hobbies and interests. I like to go rock climbing and play video games. Some of my favourite games include Ascension and Resident Evil. I love my pathfinder group, who meets weekly with one another to solve problems and gain experience.</p>
        <p>I watch and read a lot of different types of media. Whether it's Japanese Manga or Korean Mahwa, I appreciate different forms of entertainment media from my peers. I'm a big fan of anime. The movie "Paprika" inspired me to study psychology!</p>
        <p>I love to eat different kinds of foods and travel places. I recently went to Canada to visit my family. I'm currently planning a trip for South Korea in the following spring.
